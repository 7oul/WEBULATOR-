# WEBULATOR---Mini-calculator
A mini two input calcualtor made with HTML, CSS and JS

NOTE : I'm new to GitHub and I'm learning how to use it.

Please put all CSS files in a folder - call it "Styles"

Put the JS file in another folder - call it "Script"

Then put everything in one folder ( leave the HTML inside the parent folder by itself )
